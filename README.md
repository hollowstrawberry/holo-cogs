# üçì holo-cogs

This is the place for my cogs that were too spicy to go into [https://github.com/hollowstrawberry/crab-cogs](crab-cogs)

These require Red 3.5, which uses the newer Discord interaction features.

### Installation

To add one of these cogs to your instance of Red, send the following commands one by one (`[p]` is your prefix):
```
[p]load downloader
[p]repo add holo-cogs https://github.com/hollowstrawberry/holo-cogs
[p]cog install holo-cogs [cog name]
[p]load [cog name]
```

You may be prompted to respond with "I agree" after the second command.
